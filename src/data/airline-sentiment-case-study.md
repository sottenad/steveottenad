# From Tweets to Insights: Achieving 93% Sentiment Accuracy with Fine-Tuned AI Models

## Executive Summary

This case study documents the development and implementation of an advanced sentiment analysis solution for airline customer feedback on social media. Using a fine-tuned language model, we achieved remarkable accuracy rates of 93% for sentiment analysis and 99% for airline entity extraction from a relatively small training dataset. This solution enables near real-time monitoring of customer sentiment, providing actionable intelligence for brand management, customer experience improvement, and competitive analysis.

5. **Data Quality**: Ensuring high-quality training data with diverse examples

**Implementation Challenges**
- Neutral sentiment classification required more nuance
- Limited examples of certain airlines in training data
- Balancing prompt complexity with performance
- Managing occasional inconsistencies inherent to probabilistic models

## Future Enhancements

**Recommended Improvements**
1. Expand training data with additional neutral sentiment examples
2. Provide comprehensive list of target airlines to improve entity extraction
3. Implement confidence scoring for classifications
4. Develop more granular sentiment categories (beyond positive/negative/neutral)
5. Extend analysis to include topic extraction and categorization

**Potential Applications**
